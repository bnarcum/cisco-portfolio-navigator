**Separate project and repository** — not a shared branch or preview of production. Plus started from the Cisco Portfolio Navigator codebase but has its own git history, roadmap, and deployment. All new development (including Design Studio) happens **here only**.

**Live (Plus):** https://bnarcum.github.io/cisco-portfolio-navigator/

**Production (different repo — do not push here):** https://bnarcum.github.io/cisco-portfolio-navigator/

→ **[PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md)** — folder paths, git remotes, and rules so the two projects stay separate.

## What it does

Same core capabilities as Cisco Portfolio Navigator — guided planning, portfolio graph views, account planner, AI assistant (BYOK), exports, and more. See the [upstream README](https://github.com/bnarcum/cisco-portfolio-navigator) for the full feature list.

### Design Studio (Plus) — v3

Open **Design Studio** from the action bar. See [DESIGN-STUDIO.md](DESIGN-STUDIO.md).

v3 adds SVG stencils, port-based linking, 12 network + 8 room templates (Gallery), design score, suggestion engine, PoE tracking, presentation mode, and customer narrative export.

## Local development

```bash
cd "/Users/bnarcum/Projects/Cisco Portfolio Navigator"
open cisco-portfolio-navigator.html
# or
python3 -m http.server 8765
# → http://localhost:8765/cisco-portfolio-navigator.html
```

Optional tests: `npm install && npm test`

## Git

Single remote for day-to-day work:

```bash
git remote -v
# origin → https://github.com/bnarcum/cisco-portfolio-navigator.git
git push origin main
```

Optional one-way pull from production is documented in **[PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md)** — not required.
